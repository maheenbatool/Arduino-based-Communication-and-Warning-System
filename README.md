# Warning-System-

The main objective of this project is to construct an early warning system for head-on collisions of trains
by using redundant data communication facility between trains. The
increasing rate of accidents motivated the need to invent a system beneficial with cost reduction facility.
This system will play an essential role in our current railway system by facilitating the drivers to monitor
their surrounding intuitively and flexibly. This research project measures the distance between trains
continuously by communicating their locations with each other, focusing on developing an effective and
advanced system for the existing train system in Pakistan.
Our system will generate a warning when the trains are 5km apart from each other. Each train's
current moving position will be continuously calculated by a Global Positioning System (GPS) in
Latitude/Longitude (DDMM.MMMM) installed onboard. The data will be communicated to all other
trains and central server using a redundant communication system Including SMS service of existing
GSM Network and Radio communication via a transceiver module. The distance between all trains will
be calculated using trigonometry. Each train will display real-time moving train's data on a Google map
using Android Application in driver's compartment. The Android application will also send an alert
message to the central server. Warning generation module will generate a warning to inform the drivers
if the trains are approaching each other at a fast speed. The driver himself shall apply the brakes. Also,
an alert is generated depending on the train's orientation.

Each Train's current moving position will be continuously calculated by a Global Positioning System(GPS)  in lat/long(ddmm.mmmm) installed on board.
The data will be communicated  to all other trains and displayed on a Display unit.
The distance between all trains will be calculated using trigonometry.
Each train will be displayed on a Google Map in engine driverâ€™s compartment on Android Application. 
Warning Generation Module will generate warning to the drivers if trains are approaching each other at a fast speed. 
The brakes shall be applied by the driver himself.
The communication between trains and central server will be communicated using: 
GSM network. (SMS)
Radio Connection (NRF24L01)
